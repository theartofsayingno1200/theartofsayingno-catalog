## About the Collection

This collection of artworks from artist Michael Stenerson was created for the Information Organization class at the University of Iowa’s School of Library and Information Science program. The Art Of Saying No is the business name of Michae’s art practice, consisting of paintings and drawings in the genre of Style Writing, an art movement birthed on the NYC subways in the late 60's and pioneered in the 70's. The art focuses on letterforms and the abstraction of the letter’s architecture. Color and movement is central to the exploration and research of these themes. 
Michael grew up skateboarding, doing graffiti, photography, and music. Throughout the years he has continued to refine his craft and consistently stayed creative. Along with painting and music, he has worked as a professional photographer for most of his career.
